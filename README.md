# MBTI Survey Report Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the analysis of an MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) survey dataset, visualized and explored using Power BI. The project aims to provide insights into the distribution of MBTI personality types and related trends from survey responses.

## Project Structure
- **Data**: The dataset is a collection of MBTI survey responses, typically including MBTI types and other variables like age, job role, or satisfaction metrics.
- **Power BI Report** (`.pbix`): The Power BI file  contains visualizations and data models for analyzing MBTI type distributions and trends. Exportable outputs (e.g., CSV) may be used for further analysis.
- **Visuals**: e.g., pie charts, bar charts.

## Prerequisites
To replicate or extend this analysis, you need:
- **Power BI Desktop**: For viewing and editing the `.pbix` file (if available).
